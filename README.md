# Mangoboxink
MangoBOX is a fork and upgrade of fund-raising protocol Juicebox on Ethereum. It rewrites the logic and functions of Juicebox in the smart contract language of Ink! and allows the ecological projects in Polkadot to raise funds from their community and introduce the Juicebox treasury management model into the Polkadot ecosystem. Anyone can utilize the MangoBOX platform to freely create a project fundraising page, customize the funding structure, customize how the project allocates funds and reward community members with tokens.
